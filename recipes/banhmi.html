    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of flour</li>
        <li>10g of yeast</li>
        <li>300ml of warm water</li>
        <li>5g of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, mix the flour and salt together.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dissolved yeast mixture to the flour mixture and knead until a soft, smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let it rise for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a surface and gently deflate to remove excess air.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a loaf and let it rise for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Before baking, score the surface of the loaf by making small cuts with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200Â°C and bake the bread for about 25-30 minutes, or until the surface is golden brown and the bread is puffed up.</li>
        <li>Allow the bread to cool before enjoying.</li>
